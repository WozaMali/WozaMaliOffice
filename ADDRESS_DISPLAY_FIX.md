# Address Display Fix

## Issue
After fixing the foreign key constraint, the addresses are no longer showing up in the popup, but they were appearing before.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `getCustomerProfilesWithAddressesFallback` function in `supabase-services.ts`. The function was fetching all user addresses without filtering for active addresses, which could cause issues with the address display.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Address Filtering
Updated the fallback method to only fetch active addresses:

```typescript
// Get all user addresses
const { data: userAddresses, error: addressesError } = await supabase
  .from('user_addresses')
  .select('*')
  .eq('is_active', true); // Only get active addresses
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
Enhanced the logging to help debug address fetching:

```typescript
console.log('âœ… Found profiles:', profiles.length);
console.log('âœ… Found addresses:', userAddresses?.length || 0);
console.log(`Profile ${profile.email} has ${memberAddresses.length} addresses`);
```

## Files Modified

### `WozaMaliOffice/collector-app/src/lib/supabase-services.ts`
- âœ… Enhanced `getCustomerProfilesWithAddressesFallback` function
- âœ… Added filtering for active addresses only
- âœ… Added detailed debug logging
- âœ… Improved error handling and logging

## Testing Steps

1. **Refresh the collector app**
2. **Navigate to the Members page**
3. **Check if addresses are now showing up in the member cards**
4. **Click "Record Collection" on a member with an address**
5. **Verify that the popup shows the address correctly**

## Expected Results

After this fix:
- âœ… **Addresses should display in member cards**
- âœ… **Popup should show address information**
- âœ… **"Record Collection" button should be available for members with addresses**
- âœ… **Console logs should show address fetching details**

## Debug Information

The enhanced logging will show:
- Number of profiles found
- Number of addresses found
- Number of addresses per profile
- Detailed error messages if any issues occur

## Next Steps

1. **Test the address display** in the collector app
2. **Check console logs** for any errors or issues
3. **Verify that the popup save functionality** still works correctly

The address display issue should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
