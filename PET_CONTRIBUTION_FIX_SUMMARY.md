# PET Bottle Contribution Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The office app was not processing PET bottle contributions to the Green Scholar Fund when collections were approved through the Collections Management page. This was causing PET bottle transactions to be missing from the Green Scholar Fund.

## Root Cause
The `UnifiedAdminService.updateCollectionStatus()` method in `src/lib/unified-admin-service.ts` was missing the call to process PET contributions after approving collections. While other services (`office-collection-services.ts` and `admin-services.ts`) were correctly calling the PET contribution API, the main collections management interface was not.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/unified-admin-service.ts`
**Location**: Lines 674-683
**Change**: Added PET contribution processing after successful collection approval
```typescript
// After successful approval, process PET Bottles contribution for this collection (idempotent)
try {
  await fetch('/api/green-scholar/pet-bottles-contribution', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ collectionId })
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.warn('⚠️ PET contribution processing failed (non-blocking):', (e as any)?.message || e);
}
```

### 2. `backend/src/routes/collections.js`
**Location**: Lines 224-237
**Change**: Added PET contribution processing to backend collection approval route
```javascript
// Process PET Bottles contribution for Green Scholar Fund
try {
  const fetch = require('node-fetch');
  const response = await fetch(`${process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/api/green-scholar/pet-bottles-contribution`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ collectionId })
  });
  if (!response.ok) {
    console.warn('⚠️ PET contribution processing failed (non-blocking):', response.statusText);
  }
} catch (e) {
  console.warn('⚠️ PET contribution processing failed (non-blocking):', e.message);
}
```

## How the Fix Works

1. **Collection Approval**: When a collection is approved through the office app, the `UnifiedAdminService.updateCollectionStatus()` method is called.

2. **RPC Call**: The method first calls the `approve_collection` RPC to update the collection status and process wallet transactions.

3. **PET Contribution Processing**: After successful approval, the method now calls the `/api/green-scholar/pet-bottles-contribution` API endpoint.

4. **API Processing**: The API endpoint:
   - Queries the collection materials to find PET bottles
   - Calculates the contribution amount at R1.50 per kg
   - Checks for existing contributions (idempotent)
   - Inserts a new transaction in the `green_scholar_transactions` table

5. **Green Scholar Fund Update**: The contribution appears in the Green Scholar Fund page under the "Fund Overview" tab.

## Testing

A test script has been created at `test-pet-contribution-fix.js` to verify the fix works correctly.

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Go to the office app Collections Management page
2. Find a collection with PET bottle materials
3. Approve the collection
4. Check the Green Scholar Fund page
5. Verify the PET contribution appears in the fund overview

## Impact

- ✅ All PET bottle transactions now contribute to the Green Scholar Fund
- ✅ The fix is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- ✅ Non-blocking (PET processing failures won't prevent collection approval)
- ✅ Consistent with other collection approval methods in the codebase

## Files Created
- `test-pet-contribution-fix.js` - Test script to verify the fix
- `PET_CONTRIBUTION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the changes to the office app
2. Test with real collections containing PET materials
3. Monitor the Green Scholar Fund page to ensure contributions are being recorded
4. Consider running a one-time script to process any existing approved collections that might have been missed
