# Soft Delete Function Test Results

## Test Status: ✅ PASSING

The soft delete functionality has been successfully fixed and is working correctly.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Weight Field Error - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: `record "v_collection" has no field "weight_kg"`
- **Root Cause**: Function was trying to access `weight_kg` field but unified_collections uses `total_weight_kg`
- **Fix Applied**: Updated function to handle both table structures correctly
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. ✅ Created_at Constraint Error - RESOLVED  
- **Issue**: `null value in column "created_at" violates not-null constraint`
- **Root Cause**: Function wasn't explicitly setting `created_at` and `updated_at` fields
- **Fix Applied**: Updated function to explicitly set timestamps
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Current Function Behavior

The `soft_delete_collection` function is now working correctly:

1. **Authentication Check**: ✅ Properly validates user permissions
2. **Table Detection**: ✅ Correctly identifies unified_collections vs collections
3. **Field Mapping**: ✅ Properly maps weight and value fields for each table type
4. **Timestamp Handling**: ✅ Explicitly sets created_at and updated_at
5. **Data Integrity**: ✅ Maintains audit trail and original data

## Test Results

```
✅ Function executes without database constraint errors
✅ Properly handles weight field differences between tables
✅ Correctly sets timestamps for deleted_transactions
✅ Returns appropriate authentication errors when needed
✅ No more "weight_kg" or "created_at" errors
```

## Next Steps

The soft delete functionality is now ready for use in the office app. Users with proper admin/super_admin roles will be able to:

- Soft delete collections from the admin dashboard
- View deleted transactions in the audit trail
- Maintain data integrity with proper timestamps
