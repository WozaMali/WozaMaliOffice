# Admin Dashboard Test Results

## Current Status âœ…

**Database Connection**: Working  
**Collections Count**: 1 accessible collection  
**RLS Policies**: Admin access is working  

## Next Steps to Verify Admin Dashboard

### 1. Run Verification Script
Execute this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- File: WozaMaliOffice/verify-admin-dashboard.sql
-- This will show the exact data that should appear in the admin dashboard
```

### 2. Test Admin Dashboard
1. **Start the Admin/Office App**
   ```bash
   cd WozaMaliOffice
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login as Admin**
   - Use an admin account with role `admin` in the `user_profiles` table
   - Navigate to the Collections/Pickups page

3. **Expected Results**
   - âœ… Should see 1 collection in the list
   - âœ… Collection should show customer name, collector name, status, weight, value
   - âœ… Should be able to approve/reject the collection
   - âœ… Real-time updates should work

### 3. Test Real-time Updates
1. **Create a new collection** (via collector app or SQL)
2. **Verify it appears immediately** in the admin dashboard
3. **Update collection status** and verify changes appear in real-time

## Troubleshooting

### If Collections Don't Appear
1. **Check Browser Console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Admin Role** - ensure user has `role = 'admin'` in `user_profiles`
3. **Check Network Tab** - verify API calls are successful
4. **Run Diagnostic Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM unified_collections;
   SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE role = 'admin';
   ```

### If Real-time Updates Don't Work
1. **Check Supabase Real-time** is enabled
2. **Verify WebSocket Connection** in browser dev tools
3. **Check Subscription** is active in the admin services

## Expected Data Structure

The admin dashboard should display:
- **Collection Code**: e.g., "COL-2024-001"
- **Customer Name**: From `customer_name` field
- **Collector Name**: From `collector_name` field  
- **Status**: pending, approved, rejected, etc.
- **Weight**: Total weight in kg
- **Value**: Total monetary value
- **Date**: Creation date
- **Actions**: Approve/Reject buttons

## Success Criteria âœ…

- [ ] Admin dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Collection appears in the list
- [ ] Collection details are displayed correctly
- [ ] Approve/Reject functionality works
- [ ] Real-time updates work
- [ ] No console errors

The system is ready for testing! ðŸŽ‰
