# Member Page Fix Summary

## Issue
The member page was not displaying member names and addresses because:
1. The service function was using the wrong view name
2. The view returns individual address records, but the component expects member records with nested address arrays
3. The data might not be populated in the `user_addresses` table

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed View Name in Service Function
**File**: `src/lib/supabase-services.ts`
**Change**: Updated `getMemberProfilesWithUserAddresses()` to use `office_member_user_addresses_view` instead of `member_user_addresses_view`

### 2. Added Data Transformation Logic
**File**: `src/lib/supabase-services.ts`
**Change**: Added logic to transform the view data (which returns one row per address) into the expected format (one member record with nested address arrays)

The transformation:
- Groups addresses by member ID
- Creates a single member record per unique member
- Aggregates all addresses for each member into a `user_addresses` array
- Preserves all member and wallet information

### 3. Created Data Population Script
**File**: `check-and-populate-member-data.sql`
**Purpose**: Ensures there's sample data available for testing the member page

The script:
- Checks if data exists in `user_addresses`, `profiles`, and `wallets` tables
- Creates sample members if none exist
- Creates wallets for members
- Creates sample addresses (primary, pickup, secondary) for members
- Verifies the data was created successfully

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Run the Data Population Script
```sql
-- Run this in your database to ensure there's data
\i check-and-populate-member-data.sql
```

### Step 2: Test the Member Page
1. Navigate to the member page in your application
2. You should now see:
   - Member names and contact information
   - Address information for each member
   - Wallet balances and points
   - Member statistics

### Step 3: Verify Data Structure
The member page should now display:
- **Member List**: Shows all members with their basic info
- **Address Summary**: Shows address count and types for each member
- **Member Details**: Click on a member to see full details including all addresses
- **Statistics**: Shows total members, members with addresses, etc.

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, the member page should display:

1. **Statistics Cards**:
   - Total Members: Shows count of all members
   - With Addresses: Shows members who have addresses
   - Pickup Addresses: Shows members ready for collection
   - Multiple Addresses: Shows members with multiple address types

2. **Member List**:
   - Member names and contact information
   - Address type badges (primary, pickup, secondary, billing)
   - Wallet balance and points
   - Active/inactive status

3. **Member Details Modal**:
   - Full member information
   - All addresses with proper formatting
   - Address management options
   - Member statistics

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/supabase-services.ts` - Fixed service function and added data transformation
2. `check-and-populate-member-data.sql` - Created data population script
3. `test-member-page-data.sql` - Created test script to verify data availability

## Next Steps

1. Run the data population script to ensure there's test data
2. Test the member page to verify it displays correctly
3. If you still don't see data, check the browser console for any errors
4. Verify that the database views are working correctly by running the test script

The member page should now properly display member names and addresses with the new user address schema integration.
